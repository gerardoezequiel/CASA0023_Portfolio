  abstract = {Accurate land cover mapping by using coarse resolution imageries has been an attractive research topic. Sub-pixel mapping has been proven efficient for allocating sub-pixels within a mixed pixel. The most likely distribution can be determined on the condition of maximized spatial dependence. However, linear land cover like roads and rivers cannot be predicted efficiently because of weaker spatial dependence between and within mixed pixels. To obtain more accurate classification at the sub-pixel scale, an improved sub-pixel mapping method by combining spatial dependence with directivity and connectivity of linear land cover was proposed. Central line of linear land cover was extracted from fraction images to provide site-specific information. Discriminated allocation targets were accordingly designed: both connectivity and directivity were considered as important auxiliary information for allocating linear land cover, whereas only maximized spatial dependence is required for other classes. Then, simulated annealing arithmetic (SAA) was applied to optimize sub-pixel allocation. The method was evaluated visually and quantitatively with the accuracy indices. Compared with the model that considers only spatial dependence, SPM HIIPD method, attraction model and hard classifier (MLC), the improved method can increase classification accuracy at the sub-pixel scale with both simulated imageries and partial SPOT remotely sensed imagery.},

  abstract = {The study of urban heat islands (UHI) is of great importance in the context of climate change (CC). The use of satellite images has helped considerably to understand UHI, especially in analyses of land surface temperature (LST). However, available sensors have a major limitation: their low spatial resolution (100 meters, Landsat; 1000 meters, MODIS) does not allow detailed analysis of UHI. Moreover, most remote sensors are limited to daytime data collection, while UHI mainly appear during the night. The images provided by satellites that study nocturnal thermal radiation, such as MODIS, have very low spatial resolution. There is abundant literature about the fusion of images from several satellites and sensors, especially information from MODIS and Landsat. However, most of these studies have concentrated on studying the combination of congruent images in the temporal plane, to extrapolate the results obtained to other temporal instances for which there is no detailed information. In general, few studies have focused on increasing the resolution of thermal images beyond the 100 meters/pixel of Landsat.},

During nighttime the UHI effects become more evident due to the greater thermal inertia of the materials used in urban fabric. It is during the night when the heat accumulated in urban materials, especially in contexts of heat waves, can generate significant health risks. The low cooling capacity of urban construction materials negatively affects the comfort and the health of urban dwellers. However, and despite the great importance of night stress due to heat, the study of night UHIs is still underdeveloped. In this context, this paper aims to determine nighttime LST contrasting Landsat's very limited nighttime images with daytime ones. The example developed refers to heat wave situations during the summer 2015. The case study is the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (35 municipalities, 636\,km2, 3.3 million inhabitants).},

  abstract = {Remote sensing technology has seen a massive rise in popularity over the last two decades, becoming an integral part of our lives. Space-based satellite technologies facilitated access to the inaccessible terrains, helped humanitarian teams, support complex emergencies, and contributed to monitoring and verifying conflict zones. The scoping phase of this review investigated the utility of the role of remote sensing application to complement international peace and security activities owing to their ability to provide objective near real-time insights at the ground level. The first part of this review looks into the major research concepts and implementation of remote sensing-based techniques for international peace and security applications and presented a meta-analysis on how advanced sensor capabilities can support various aspects of peace and security. With key examples, we demonstrated how this technology assemblage enacts multiple versions of peace and security: for refugee relief operations, in armed conflicts monitoring, tracking acts of genocide, providing evidence in courts of law, and assessing contravention in human rights. The second part of this review anticipates future challenges that can hinder the applicative capabilities of remote sensing in peace and security. Varying types of sensors pose discrepancies in image classifications and issues like cost, resolution, and difficulty of ground-truth in conflict areas. With emerging technologies and sufficient secondary resources available, remote sensing plays a vital operational tool in conflict-affected areas by supporting an extensive diversity in public policy actions for peacekeeping processes.},

  abstract = {Urban heat islands (UHIs) have become an especially relevant phenomenon as a consequence of global warming and the growing proportion of people living in cities. The health impacts that are sometimes attributed to the rise in temperature generated in an UHI are not always adequately justified. The objective is to analyse what effect UHIs have on maximum (Tmax) and minimum daily temperatures (Tmin) recorded in urban and non-urban observatories, and quantify the impact on morbidity and mortality during heat waves in Spain's five cities. Data were collected on natural-cause daily mortality and unscheduled emergency hospital admissions (ICD-10: A00-R99) registered in these 5 cities across the period 2014–2018. We analysed daily Tmax and Tmin values at urban and non-urban observatories in these cities, and quantified the impact of Tmax and Tmin values during heat waves in each of these cities, using GLM models that included Tmax only, Tmin only, and both. We controlled for air pollution and other meteorological variables, as well as for seasonalities, trend and the autoregressive nature of the series. The UHI effect was observed in Tmin but not in Tmax, and proved to be greater in coastal cities than in inland and more densely populated cities. The UHI value in relation to the mean Tmin in the summer months ranged from 1.2~°C in Murcia to 4.1~°C in Valencia (difference between urban/non-urban observatories). The modelling process showed that, while a statistically significant association (p~{$<~$}0.05) was observed in inland cities with Tmax for mortality and hospital admissions in heat waves, in coastal cities the association was obtained with Tmin, and the only impact in this case was the UHI effect on morbidity and mortality. No generalisations can be made about the impact of UHI on morbidity and mortality among the exposed population in cities. Studies on a local scale are called for, since it is local factors that determine whether the UHI effect will have a greater or lesser impact on health during heat-wave events.},

  abstract = {Limited awareness of environmental remote sensing's potential ability to support environmental policy development constrains the technology's utilization. This paper reviews the potential of earth observation from the perspective of environmental policy. A literature review of "remote sensing and policy" revealed that while the number of publications in this field increased almost twice as rapidly as that of remote sensing literature as a whole (15.3 versus 8.8\% yr−1), there is apparently little academic interest in the societal contribution of environmental remote sensing. This is because none of the more than 300 peer reviewed papers described actual policy support. This paper describes and discusses the potential, actual support, and limitations of earth observation with respect to supporting the various stages of environmental policy development. Examples are given of the use of remote sensing in problem identification and policy formulation, policy implementation, and policy control and evaluation. While initially, remote sensing contributed primarily to the identification of environmental problems and policy implementation, more recently, interest expanded to applications in policy control and evaluation. The paper concludes that the potential of earth observation to control and evaluate, and thus assess the efficiency and effectiveness of policy, offers the possibility of strengthening governance.},

  abstract = {Trends of extreme-temperature episodes in cities are increasing (in frequency, magnitude and duration) due to regional climate change in interaction with urban effects. Urban morphologies and thermal properties of the materials used to build them are factors that influence spatial and temporal climate variability and are one of the main reasons for the climatic singularity of cities. This paper presents a methodology to evaluate the urban and peri-urban effect on extreme-temperature exposure in Barcelona (Spain), using the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification as a basis, which allows a comparison with other cities of the world characterised using this criterion. LCZs were introduced as input of the high-resolution UrbClim model (100 m spatial resolution) to create daily temperature (median and maximum) series for summer (JJA) during the period 1987 to 2016, pixel by pixel, in order to create a cartography of extremes. Using the relationship between mortality due to high temperatures and temperature distribution, the heat exposure of each LCZ was obtained. Methodological results of the paper show the improvement obtained when LCZs were mapped through a combination of two techniques (land cover–land use maps and the World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools – WUDAPT – method), and the paper proposes a methodology to obtain the exposure to high temperatures of different LCZs in urban and peri-urban areas. In the case of Barcelona, the distribution of temperatures for the 90th percentile (about 3–4 ∘C above the average conditions) leads to an increase in the relative risk of mortality of 80 \%.},

  abstract = {Cities are recognised as key enablers for the world's sustainable future. Urban sprawl and inefficient use of land are important issues significantly impacting the provision and use of open green spaces. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 11.7.1 aims at globally monitoring the amount of land that is dedicated by cities for public space. In Europe, the indicator "Share of urban population without green urban areas in their neighbourhood" is supposed to correspond to the SDG11.7.1 but is currently on-hold due to methodological issues and lack of data. Moreover, to efficiently assess public space conditions, timely and spatially disaggregated information is essential but not yet widely adopted by urban practitioners. Hereafter, we use a combination of satellite and crowdsourced Earth Observations (EO) to model physical accessibility to urban green spaces in four European cities. Findings suggest that it is technically feasible to derive information on the share of urban population without green urban areas in their neighbourhood. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology represents a consistent, valid, reliable, low-cost, timely and continuous source of information for sustainable urban development. Open and free EO data can be a good complement to enhance official and traditional statistics on urban areas facilitating EU reporting against the SDG indicator for better comparison between EU countries.},

The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

  abstract = {Background High ambient temperatures are associated with many health effects, including premature mortality. The combination of global warming due to climate change and the expansion of the global built environment mean that the intensification of urban heat islands (UHIs) is expected, accompanied by adverse effects on population health. Urban green infrastructure can reduce local temperatures. We aimed to estimate the mortality burden that could be attributed to UHIs and the mortality burden that would be prevented by increasing urban tree coverage in 93 European cities. Methods We did a quantitative health impact assessment for summer (June 1–Aug 31), 2015, of the effect of UHIs on all-cause mortality for adults aged 20 years or older in 93 European cities. We also estimated the temperature reductions that would result from increasing tree coverage to 30\% for each city and estimated the number of deaths that could be potentially prevented as a result. We did all analyses at a high-resolution grid-cell level (250\,×\,250 m). We propagated uncertainties in input analyses by using Monte Carlo simulations to obtain point estimates and 95\% CIs. We also did sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our estimates. Findings The population-weighted mean city temperature increase due to UHI effects was 1·5°C (SD 0·5; range 0·5–3·0). Overall, 6700 (95\% CI 5254–8162) premature deaths could be attributable to the effects of UHIs (corresponding to around 4·33\% [95\% CI 3·37–5·28] of all summer deaths). We estimated that increasing tree coverage to 30\% would cool cities by a mean of 0·4°C (SD 0·2; range 0·0–1·3). We also estimated that 2644 (95\% CI 2444–2824) premature deaths could be prevented by increasing city tree coverage to 30\%, corresponding to 1·84\% (1·69–1·97) of all summer deaths. Interpretation Our results showed the deleterious effects of UHIs on mortality and highlighted the health benefits of increasing tree coverage to cool urban environments, which would also result in more sustainable and climate-resilient cities.

  abstract = {The Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA) is located in Catalonia, northeastern Spain. With a population of over 3 billion people, the BMA is one of the most populous metropolitan areas on the Mediterranean coast. A local climatic modification known as the urban heat island (UHI) occurs in the urban areas. The UHI is usually quantified by means of air temperature, although remote sensing can be used to extract a thermal image of the earth's surface to provide temperature values throughout the study area. Estimation of the land surface temperature (LST) for the BMA enabled us to establish the spatial patterns of LST and to detect the poles of heat and cold within the BMA on 24 dates during the 2013–2018 period, distributed among the 4 seasons of the year. To this end we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) and a cluster analysis (CA). Moreover, we employed the Random Forest (RF) regression method to quantify the influence and variation of diverse geographic covariates according to season and location in the study area. Finally, to determine the influence of land covers on temperature, the thermal values of the 4 land covers included in the Corine Land Cover dataset were analyzed: industrial units, continuous urban fabric, green urban areas, and forest areas. Results show that the heat poles are concentrated in industrial areas primarily, followed by urban fabric areas. On the contrary, the cold pole is found in green urban areas, as well as forested areas. The maximum temperature range between land covers was detected in spring and summer, while in winter this difference was negligible. Our study showed that green urban areas presented temperatures up to 2.5\,°C lower than in urban areas. The results of the present research are intended to serve as a roadmap for enhancing thermal comfort in the BMA.},

  abstract = {Developing countries are required to produce robust estimates of forest carbon stocks for successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies related to reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD). Here we present a "benchmark" map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for REDD assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49\%, 25\%, and 26\% of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from ±6\% to ±53\%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national ({$>$}1,000,000 ha) scales at               ca               . ±5\% and               ca               . ±1\%, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of urbanization, the ecological environment is being degraded. Taking the Barcelona Metropolitan Region as an example, this paper developed an ecological environment quality-assessment system suitable for different times and regions, based on remote sensing, to evaluate the quality of the ecological environment from 2006 to 2018. We also built various ordinary least squares models to analyze multiple variables affecting the ecological environment. Finally, the characteristic triangular spatial structure was used to explain the interaction between the two key variables. The results showed that the ecological quality was unevenly distributed. The largest green space contributed the most benefits but was decreasing and becoming fragmented. NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) was the most significant natural variable related to the distribution of green space. Precipitation was the most closely related climate factor to NDVI. There was a complex two-way interaction mechanism between the two, and its boundary value was getting higher and higher. In conclusion, the environmental quality of the BMR needs improvement. The characteristic triangle can effectively explain the interaction mechanism between precipitation and NDVI. This study deeply analyzes how various factors affect environmental quality from both the global and internal perspectives and provides a scientific basis for urban ecological management and sustainable development.},

The development and utilisation of UAV platforms requires broad technical skills covering the three major facets of remote sensing: data acquisition, data post-processing, and image analysis. In this study, UAV image data acquired by a miniature 6-band multispectral imaging sensor was corrected and calibrated using practical image-based data post-processing techniques. Data correction techniques included dark offset subtraction to reduce sensor noise, flat-field derived per-pixel look-up-tables to correct vignetting, and implementation of the Brown- Conrady model to correct lens distortion. Radiometric calibration was conducted with an image-based empirical line model using pseudo-invariant features (PIFs). Sensor corrections and radiometric calibration improve the quality of the data, aiding quantitative analysis and generating consistency with other calibrated datasets.},

  abstract = {The importance of land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from high to medium spatial resolution remote sensing data for many environmental studies, particularly the applications related to water resources management over agricultural sites, was a key factor for the final decision of including a thermal infrared (TIR) instrument on board the Landsat Data Continuity Mission or Landsat-8. This new TIR sensor (TIRS) includes two TIR bands in the atmospheric window between 10 and 12 {$\mu$} m, thus allowing the application of split-window (SW) algorithms in addition to single-channel (SC) algorithms or direct inversions of the radiative transfer equation used in previous sensors on board the Landsat platforms, with only one TIR band. In this letter, we propose SC and SW algorithms to be applied to Landsat-8 TIRS data for LST retrieval. Algorithms were tested with simulated data obtained from forward simulations using atmospheric profile databases and emissivity spectra extracted from spectral libraries. Results show mean errors typically below 1.5 K for both SC and SW algorithms, with slightly better results for the SW algorithm than for the SC algorithm with increasing atmospheric water vapor contents.},

Established towards the end of 2010, it provides access to satellite and other ancillary data, cloud computing, and algorithms for processing large amounts of data with relative ease. However, the uptake and usage of the opportunity remains varied and unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the usage patterns of the Google Earth Engine platform and whether researchers in developing countries were making use of the opportunity. Analysis of published literature showed that a total of 300 journal papers were published between 2011 and June 2017 that used GEE in their research, spread across 158 journals. The highest number of papers were in the journal Remote Sensing, followed by Remote Sensing of Environment. There were also a number of papers in premium journals such as Nature and Science. The application areas were quite varied, ranging from forest and vegetation studies to medical fields such as malaria. Landsat was the most widely used dataset; it is the biggest component of the GEE data portal, with data from the first to the current Landsat series available for use and download. Examination of data also showed that the usage was dominated by institutions based in developed nations, with study sites mainly in developed nations. There were very few studies originating from institutions based in less developed nations and those that targeted less developed nations, particularly in the African continent.},

  abstract = {Increasing demand for land resources at the coast has exerted immense pressure on vulnerable environments. Population and economic growth in coastal cities have combined to produce a scarcity of suitable space for development, the response to which has frequently been the reclamation of land from the sea, most prominently in China. Urbanization is a key driver of such changes and a detailed investigation of coastal land reclamation at the city scale is required. This study analyzed remote sensing imagery for the period 1990 to 2018 to explore the trajectories of coastal land reclamation in nine major urban agglomerations across the three largest deltas in China using the JRC Global Surface Water (Yearly Water Classification History, v1.1) (GSW) dataset on the Google Earth Engine platform. The results are considered in the context of major national policy reforms over the last three decades. The analysis reveals that total land reclaimed among nine selected cities had exceeded 2800 km2 since 1984, 82\% of which occurred after 2000, a year following the enactment of China's agricultural `red line' policy. Shanghai exhibited the greatest overall area of land extension, followed by Ningbo and Tianjin, especially in the period following the privatization of property rights in 2004. In analyzing annual trends, we identified the developmental stages of a typical coastal reclamation project and how these vary between cities. Scrutiny of the results revealed voids in nighttime light satellite data (2014--2018) in some localities. Although these voids appeared to be characterized by construction, they were occupied by vacant buildings, and were therefore examples of so-called ``ghost cities.'' In China, as elsewhere, continual land reclamation needs to be considered in relation to, inter alia, sea level rise and land subsidence that pose significant challenges to the vision of sustainable urban development in these three deltaic megacities.},

  abstract = {Pakistan falls significantly below the recommended forest coverage level of 20 to 30 percent of total area, with less than 6 percent of its land under forest cover. This deficiency is primarily attributed to illicit deforestation for wood and charcoal, coupled with a failure to embrace advanced techniques for forest estimation, monitoring, and supervision. Remote sensing techniques leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite images were employed. Both single-layer stacked images and temporal layer stacked images from various dates were utilized for forest classification. The application of an artificial neural network (ANN) supervised classification algorithm yielded notable results. Using a single-layer stacked image from Sentinel-2, an impressive 91.37\% training overall accuracy and 0.865 kappa coefficient were achieved, along with 93.77\% testing overall accuracy and a 0.902 kappa coefficient. Furthermore, the temporal layer stacked image approach demonstrated even better results. This method yielded 98.07\% overall training accuracy, 97.75\% overall testing accuracy, and kappa coefficients of 0.970 and 0.965, respectively. The random forest (RF) algorithm, when applied, achieved 99.12\% overall training accuracy, 92.90\% testing accuracy, and kappa coefficients of 0.986 and 0.882. Notably, with the temporal layer stacked image of the Sentinel-2 satellite, the RF algorithm reached exceptional performance with 99.79\% training accuracy, 96.98\% validation accuracy, and kappa coefficients of 0.996 and 0.954. In terms of forest cover estimation, the ANN algorithm identified 31.07\% total forest coverage in the District Abbottabad region. In comparison, the RF algorithm recorded a slightly higher 31.17\% of the total forested area. This research highlights the potential of advanced remote sensing techniques and machine learning algorithms in improving forest cover assessment and monitoring strategies.},

  abstract = {A wide range of methods for analysis of airborne- and satellite-derived imagery continues to be proposed and assessed. In this paper, we review remote sensing implementations of support vector machines (SVMs), a promising machine learning methodology. This review is timely due to the exponentially increasing number of works published in recent years. SVMs are particularly appealing in the remote sensing field due to their ability to generalize well even with limited training samples, a common limitation for remote sensing applications. However, they also suffer from parameter assignment issues that can significantly affect obtained results. A summary of empirical results is provided for various applications of over one hundred published works (as of April, 2010). It is our hope that this survey will provide guidelines for future applications of SVMs and possible areas of algorithm enhancement.},

  abstract = {Historically, geoscience has been a prominent domain for applications of computer vision and pattern recognition. The numerous challenges associated with geoscience-related imaging data, which include poor imaging quality, noise, missing values, lack of precise boundaries defining various geoscience objects and processes, as well as non-stationarity in space and/or time, provide an ideal test bed for advanced computer vision techniques. On the other hand, the developments in pattern recognition, especially with the rapid evolution of powerful graphical processing units (GPUs) and the subsequent deep learning breakthrough, enable valuable computational tools, which can aid geoscientists in important problems, such as land cover mapping, target detection, pattern mining in imaging data, boundary extraction and change detection. In this landscape, classical computer vision approaches, such as active contours, superpixels, or descriptor-guided classification, provide alternatives that remain relevant when domain expert labelling of large sample collections is often not feasible. This issue persists, despite efforts for the standardization of geoscience datasets, such as Microsoft's effort for AI on Earth, or Google Earth. This work covers developments in applications of computer vision and pattern recognition on geoscience-related imaging data, following both pre-deep learning and post-deep learning paradigms. Various imaging modalities are addressed, including: multispectral images, hyperspectral images (HSIs), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, point clouds obtained from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors or digital elevation models (DEMs).},
