## Welcome to my CASA0023 Learning Diary {.unnumbered}

This is where I'll be sharing my experiences from CASA0023 - Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments, part of my Urban Spatial Science MSc at UCL's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis. Over the coming weeks, I'll be getting hands-on with new techniques, diving into research papers, and putting remote sensing methods into practice while reflecting on what I'm learning along the way.

A bit about me - I’m Gerardo Ezequiel—spatial data scientist, environmental scientist by training, and a firm believer that cities hold the key to a more sustainable future. My world revolves around maps (digital, paper, mental—you name it), urban data, and a good cup of coffee. Seriously, if there’s a map involved, I’m interested. If there’s coffee, even better.

## Why Remote Sensing?

I’ve worked with geospatial data for a while now, but remote sensing has always felt like this vast, slightly intimidating universe. I’ve often relied on pre-processed datasets, but I’ve also hit my fair share of dead ends—searching for cloud-free images, struggling with mismatched spatial resolutions, or just wondering what half the jargon even means. Turns out, satellites don’t just magically deliver the perfect dataset on demand (who knew?).

That’s why I’m here. This is my chance to demystify remote sensing, get hands-on with raw satellite data, and understand what’s actually going on under the hood. I want to go from just using ready-made products to properly analysing, processing, and making sense of the data myself.

Consider this diary my personal notebook - a place to jot down observations, lightbulb moments and the occasional frustration. Let's see where this adventure leads!
